description:
  flat-mcmc is a Haskell library for painless, efficient, general-purpose
  sampling from continuous distributions.
  .
  flat-mcmc uses an ensemble sampler that is invariant to affine
  transformations of space.  It wanders a target probability distribution's
  parameter space as if it had been "flattened" or "unstretched" in some sense,
  allowing many particles to explore it locally and in parallel.
  .
  In general this sampler is useful when you want decent performance without
  dealing with any tuning parameters or local proposal distributions.
  .
  flat-mcmc exports an 'mcmc' function that prints a trace to stdout, as well
  as a 'flat' transition operator that can be used more generally.
